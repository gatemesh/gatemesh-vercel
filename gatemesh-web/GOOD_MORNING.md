## 📁 Key Changes

### Property Name Migration
Your code was using old property names. I updated everything:

```typescript
// Before (WRONG)         →  After (CORRECT)
node.name               →  node.userGivenName
node.hardware           →  node.hardwareId
node.roles              →  node.nodeTypes (array)
node.status             →  node.state (enum)
node.signal             →  node.rssi
node.location.gps.lat   →  node.location.lat
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Current Setup
- **Main Entry:** `main.tsx` renders `App.tsx` (dashboard)
- **Marketing Site:** `GateMeshWebsite.tsx` exists but not currently routed
- **Test Mode:** Add `?test` to URL to load `TestApp.tsx`

### If You Want to Use the Marketing Site
You have two options:

1. **Integrate it into main app** - Add routing in App.tsx
2. **Make it the default** - Change main.tsx to render GateMeshWebsite

Let me know if you want help with either option!

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (Your Choice)

- [ ] Test the dashboard (`pnpm dev`)
- [ ] Review the marketing website code
- [ ] Decide if you want to integrate GateMeshWebsite into routing
- [ ] Deploy to staging/production
- [ ] Add more features or content
