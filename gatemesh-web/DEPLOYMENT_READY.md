# 🚀 GateMesh Website - Deployment Ready

**Status: ✅ READY FOR VERCEL DEPLOYMENT**

---

## What Changed

Your Vercel deployment will now show the **GateMesh Marketing Website** by default instead of the dashboard app.

### URL Routing

- **`https://your-site.vercel.app`** → Marketing website (homepage)
- **`https://your-site.vercel.app?app`** → Web dashboard (irrigation app)
- **`https://your-site.vercel.app?test`** → Test app

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Entry Point (`main.tsx`)

```typescript
// Default: Marketing website
// Add ?app to URL to access dashboard
// Add ?test to URL to access test app

Default: GateMeshWebsite
?app   : App (dashboard)
?test  : TestApp
```

### 2. Added Navigation to Web App

The marketing website now has a prominent **"Web App"** button in the header that links to `?app`:

**Desktop:**
- Green button in top-right of header (before Sign In)
- Labeled "Web App"

**Mobile:**
- Button in mobile menu
- Appears before Sign In button

These settings are already correct - no changes needed.

---

## Post-Deployment Checklist

After deploying to Vercel:

- [ ] Visit your Vercel URL - should see marketing homepage
- [ ] Click "Web App" button - should redirect to `?app`
- [ ] Test login with demo account (demo@gatemesh.com / demo123)
- [ ] Verify all marketing pages work (Products, Pricing, etc.)
- [ ] Test on mobile device
- [ ] Check browser console for errors (should be none)

---

## Rollback Plan

If you need to revert to the old behavior (dashboard as default):

Edit `packages/web/src/main.tsx`:

```typescript
// Change this line:
let AppComponent = GateMeshWebsite;

// Back to:
let AppComponent = App;
```

Then commit and push.

---

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to set up a custom domain:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Domains
2. Add your domain (e.g., gatemesh.com)
3. Follow Vercel's instructions to update DNS
4. Wait for SSL certificate (automatic)

Recommended structure:
- `gatemesh.com` → Marketing website
- `gatemesh.com?app` → Dashboard
- Or: `app.gatemesh.com` → Dashboard (requires separate deployment or routing)

---
